The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation

Download the dataset
Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

Variables:
features_data <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns 
activity_labels <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns 
subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column 
x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns 
y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns 
subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column 
x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns 
y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns 

Merges train set and test set into one dataset
x_bind (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
y_bind (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
subject_bind (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
merged_data (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
TidyData (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting Merged_Data, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

Change labels dataset with descriptive variable names
code column in TidyData renamed into activity
All Acc in column’s name renamed into  Accelerometer
All Gyro in column’s name renamed into  Gyroscope
All BodyBody in column’s name enamed into Body
All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
All start with character t in column’s name enamed into Time
All start with character f in column’s name enamed into Frequency
